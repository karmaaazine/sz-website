        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Salma Zine a student in ESTL majoring in computer science,
            you're looking at my own website, you'll find all
            information here. I am currently living in Laayoune,
            Morocco which is known as the capital of the Sahara.
            I was born on the 5th of march 2003, and I have been interested in
            computing since the age of 9 when my dad first bought my sister a
            computer. From then on I became very interested in computing. My first
            program was a simple program in C which includes Hello world. Then I moved to C++,
            and after that, I started to learn HTML and CSS, I found it very interesting because
            computing is something that has a lot of uses in our world. In addition to school, my
            hobbies include singing, listening to music, and reading books (especially novels).
            My favorite singers are Celine Dion and Rihanna. Through the years I
            have participated in many competitions, Therefore, I think that my passion for computing
            has helped me a lot to achieve this success. My goal is to study computing at the University
            level and become an expert in it so I can work in the IT industry or start my own company.
            Another reason which makes me want to study computing at university is that from the
            beginning of secondary school until now I have always been one of the top students in
            all subjects including mathematics. I'm currently learning Javascript to expand my knowledge in web
            development.</p>
